## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to analyze room booking data using IBM Cloud and Watson Studio. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning models to predict booking cancellations and optimize room allocation.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this project, ensure you have the following:
- An IBM Cloud account
- Watson Studio set up on IBM Cloud
- Basic knowledge of Python and data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/room-booking-data-analysis.git
    cd room-booking-data-analysis
    ```

2. **Install necessary Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Upload the project to Watson Studio:**
    - Create a new project in Watson Studio.
    - Upload the cloned repository files to your Watson Studio project.

4. **Set up IBM Cloud services:**
    - Ensure you have the necessary IBM Cloud services such as Watson Machine Learning.

```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is `room_booking_data.csv`, which contains information about room bookings. The columns include:
- `BookingID`
- `CustomerID`
- `CheckInDate`
- `CheckOutDate`
- `RoomType`
- `BookingStatus`
- `CustomerRating`
- `TotalAmount`

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into four main parts:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean the data.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize data distributions and relationships.
   - Identify trends and patterns.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
   - Evaluate model performance.

4. **Results Visualization:**
   - Visualize model results and metrics.
   - Interpret findings and provide recommendations.

## Results
The key findings from the analysis include:
- Trends in booking patterns (seasonality, peak times).
- Customer preferences for different room types.
- Factors influencing booking cancellations.
- Predictive model performance metrics.
